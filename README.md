# Timezone Converter

This app tells the current day, date, and time in a given timezone.
It assumes a default timezone of the user is New York.
Input follows this format:

```
node tz "timezone"
```

You may optionally include `--format` to display the date and time in a much more easily readable format.

A complete list of timezone inputs can be found [here] (https://gist.github.com/diogocapela/12c6617fc87607d11fd62d2a4f42b02a)

When entering a timezone, it must be exactly as it appears in the above list, with no spaces. It also must be in quotes (single or double).
